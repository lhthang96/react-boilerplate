   * - `styled-components`
   *
   * Those libraries will be setup using by cdn in ./templates/index.prod.html
   *
   * ### Why?
   *
   * This is another way to reduce app bundle size. In production, those libraries won't be bundled in the
   * main script file. Instead, they will be downloaded via CDN.
   *
   * **Pros**:
   *  - Reduce main bundle size.
   *  - They can easily cached by downloading via CDN.
   *
   * **Cons**:
   *  - Need to frequently check libraries version to make sure app works normally.
   *  - Have to manually setup cdn version in production html template when needed.
   *  - There is a risk by using CDN since it's a third-party service.
